Air Quality Data in India (2015 - 2020)
Air Quality Index (AQI) and hourly data across stations and cities in India

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/air-quality-data-in-india

The dataset contains air quality data and AQI (Air Quality Index) at hourly and daily level of various stations across multiple cities in India.


Columns

•	City 
(Ahmedabad, Aizawl, Amaravati, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Bhopal, Brajrajnagar, Chandigarh, Chennai, Coimbatore, Delhi, Ernakulam, Gurugram, Guwahati, Hyderabad, Jaipur, Jorapokhar, Kochi, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, Patna, Shillong, Talcher, Thiruvananthapuram, Visakhapatnam)

•	Date	

•	PM2.5,	PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, NH3, CO, SO2, O3, Benzene, Toluene	, Xylene
	
•	AQI	

•	AQI Bucket



Data Quality Checks

•	Missing Values: Checked for missing values in each column to ensure
data completeness.
•	Outliers: Identified and handled outliers in numerical columns.

Trends and Patterns

•	Temporal Trends: Explored how sensor readings, flow rates, pressure,
and temperature change over time.
•	Correlations: Investigated correlations between different parameters.

How does AQI change with time? Which city has worst AQI?




Visualizations

Time Series Plots: Plotted time series graphs for AQI, PM 2.5 and PM 10.


Statistical Analysis

1. Descriptive Statistics: Calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and
other summary statistics for AQI.
2. Hypothesis Testing: Performed hypothesis tests to compare different
groups or conditions.


 
   


•	The graphs show that air pollution for all cities was reduced in 2020 due to the covid 19 induced lockdown.

•	The graphs also show pollution comparison of different cities. The same can be used to study initiatives in cities with less pollution and problems in cities with high air pollution.
